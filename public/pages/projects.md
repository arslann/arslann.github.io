## [visa-termin-alert](https://github.com/noworneverev/visa-termin-alert) üîó

- The project is inspired by a terminated chatbot service which is aimed at providing instant German visa appointments status. As you may know, it is extremely difficult to book an appointment to apply German visa in Taiwan in busy season, one may have to refresh the termin page ALL DAY LONG FOR SEVERAL DAYS to reserve a seat. Since the German Institue don't tell us when vacant appointments will be released exactly, I built this chatbot to notify those who want to arrange appointments.

## [go-germany](https://noworneverev.github.io/go-germany/) üîó

- As a prospective master student in Germany, I spent a lot of time searching for international programs and their related articles shared by applicants. I know there's a [DAAD site](https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/international-programmes/en/result/?cert=&admReq=&langExamPC=&scholarshipLC=&langExamLC=&scholarshipSC=&langExamSC=&degree%5B%5D=&fos=&langDeAvailable=&langEnAvailable=&lang%5B%5D=&cit%5B%5D=&tyi%5B%5D=&ins%5B%5D=&fee=&bgn%5B%5D=&dat%5B%5D=&prep_subj%5B%5D=&prep_degree%5B%5D=&sort=4&dur=&subjects%5B%5D=&q=&limit=10&offset=&display=list) which is helpful for searching the desired program; however, I don't like the way it displays search results and I think if I can find related articles shared by former applicants at the same time, that would be simply awesome, so I created this site. I want to create a search tool so amazing that it'll be the one you find your desired programs -- I think this it.
